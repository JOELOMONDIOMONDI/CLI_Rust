Project Idea: To-Do List CLI Application

Description:
Create a command-line to-do list application where users can add, remove, and view tasks. This project will cover basic file I/O operations, error handling, and structuring a small Rust application.

Features:

Add Task: Allow users to add tasks to the to-do list with a description and optional due date.
Remove Task: Enable users to remove tasks from the list by specifying the task's index or description.

List Tasks: Display all tasks in the to-do list along with their status (completed or pending) and due dates.

Save/Load Tasks: Persist the to-do list to a file so that users can resume their tasks between sessions.
Implementation Steps:



Initialize Project: Create a new Rust project using Cargo.

Define Task Struct: Define a Task struct to represent individual tasks with fields
 like description, status, and due date (optional). **

Implement Command-line Interface: Use a library like structopt to define 
command-line arguments for adding, removing, listing tasks, etc.

Implement Task Management Functions: Write functions to add, remove, and list tasks. 
Handle error cases gracefully.

Implement File I/O: Implement functions to save and load tasks from a 
file using Rust's file I/O facilities.

Unit Testing: Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of your functions, 
especially those related to task management and file I/O.

Error Handling: Implement error handling to deal with invalid input, file I/O errors, etc.

Documentation: Document your code using Rust's built-in documentation features (/// comments).

Refactoring and Optimization: Refactor your code to improve readability and optimize performance if needed.

Polishing: Add any additional features or enhancements you find interesting,
 such as task prioritization, color-coded output, etc.

Learning Objectives:

Basic Rust syntax and concepts (structs, functions, enums, etc.).
Command-line argument parsing using structopt.
File I/O operations in Rust.
Error handling using Result and ? operator.
Unit testing in Rust.
Documentation and code organization best practices.
This project will give you a hands-on experience with Rust while keeping the scope manageable for a beginner. As you progress, you can extend the project with more advanced features or explore other areas of Rust development.
